<h4>EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT PizzaCut</h4>
<p>The first New Zealand PizzaCut restaurant opened in New Lynn (Auckland) in September 1974. We currently have over 100 PizzaCut stores throughout New Zealand. Nearly everyone anywhere can enjoy a tasty PizzaCut pizza!</p>



<h4>OUR PIZZAS</h4>
<p>PizzaCut in New Zealand stands for serving the best quality pizzas in New Zealand.</p>

<p>To do this we’re constantly looking at new products which we’ve developed for Kiwis, or delicious dishes that may have been hugely successful overseas and which we know will appeal to discerning New Zealanders.</p>

<p>It’s all about quality, taste and excitement – and key to that is ‘fresh’.</p>

<p>All PizzaCut dough is made fresh, from scratch, in store daily – yes, daily... from scratch.</p>

<p>All our ingredients are sourced from quality suppliers who must meet our stringent standards of excellence.</p>

<p>All our pizzas and delicious sides and desserts are made to order and under strict guidelines.</p>
